1.	Furniture Business

A furniture business sells hand-made tables.  Create a class that describes one hand made table.   The table will be made of one of the following woods:  oak, maple, or cherry.  The wood will have either a dark stain, a light stain, or no stain. The table will have a maximum of 4 drawers, but may have as few as 0 drawers.  The table will also have a sale price.  This class must include a constructor that takes no input arguments and also an overloaded constructor that takes an input argument for each attribute.  The class must include a set and get method for each attribute.  The class must also include a method that will print out the current values of all attributes to the console.  For now this class does not include any problem specific methods.

Create a main method that is in a separate class including no attributes and no other methods besides main.  The main method will create one table that made of cherry wood and has no stain on it.  This table has 3 drawers and is sold for $1500.  The main method must create a second table that is made of oak and has no drawers, but it does have a dark stain.  This second table costs $1275. The main method must also create a table that has a light stain, is made of maple and has 4 drawers and costs $500.  Each of these tables must be created and printed out in the main method.

Constants 
•	Maximum drawers = 4
•	Minimum drawers = 0
•	Table one price = 1500
•	Table two price  = 1275
•	Table three price = 500
•	Part I.   Program Design
o	Rewrite the problem statement in your own words using short bulleted phrases
o	Create a class skeleton for this problem – show your attribute declarations and appropriate comment descriptions.  Also show comment header blocks for your methods.  You do not need to include the code for the methods at this point.  Note you do not have to include MyUtilityClass and its methods in the design work.
